Problem Report: Audio File Not Showing After Upload + Loop Progress Bug
Hi, I’m facing an issue on the Audio Management (Audio File Library) page that persists even after uploading or recording new audio files.

🧨 Current Behavior (Bug):
When I upload or record a new audio file:

It does not appear in the Audio File Library list immediately.

The view instead shows a looping “progress” indicator or placeholder.

The list keeps polling every few seconds, but the uploaded file never shows up.

Only a manual page refresh reveals the new file.

🧪 What I see in the console logs:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Audio Management polling - query data: []
Audio Management polling check: {dataType: 'object', isArray: true, dataLength: 0, hasProcessing: false, statuses: Array(0)}
(repeats over and over)
📌 What this means:
The polling is working — it checks every few seconds.

But the query data returned is an empty array, so nothing is rendered.

Even though the file was uploaded or recorded, it’s not returned in the API response (query.data = []), so the UI keeps showing an empty list.

🔍 Summary of Likely Issue:
The frontend polling logic is correct now (you’re using TanStack Query v5's queryFn, accessing query.state.data properly).

But the backend or caching layer isn't returning the newly uploaded file.

Either the new file isn’t saved properly,

or the query returns stale/filtered/empty data.

✅ Suggestions:
Please check the following:

✅ Does the server actually store the uploaded file?

Can you log or inspect the backend response after upload?

Confirm that the uploaded file is added to the correct list in the database.

✅ Does the query for Audio Management page return the correct data immediately after upload?

Please confirm that the query returns the new file.

If it doesn't, maybe there’s a filter condition or a stale cache issue?

✅ Can you temporarily log the raw API response from the backend for the audio file list endpoint — immediately after upload?

🙏 Request:
Could you please:

Ensure that the uploaded file is returned by the Audio Management query (not just stored)?

Add any logging or error handling to trace the file lifecycle from upload → query visibility?

Let me know if you'd like me to reproduce the issue again or record a short clip.
Thanks a lot for your help!
